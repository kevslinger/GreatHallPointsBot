# Features:
# [X] Log into r/HP
# [X] Connect to a google sheet
# [X] Track comments in r/HP
# [X] Parse comments for select phrase (e.g. !HousePoints)
# [X] If the user's flair is not set to a house, let them know they can't get house points without setting it.
#       TODO: Should we still add these posts to the sheet?
# [X] OP cannot use !HousePoints on their own submission
#       - Unless it's a mod of the sub
# [X] If everything is clean (OP not awarding to themselves, user has house flair set), then grab the URL and put it
#       On a google sheet.
# [X] Keep a dataframe of all the new records (posts) and then at the end of each day, append to the sheet
# [X] Make sure duplicates are not added.
# [ ] Create a new sheet every month.
#       Issue is that schedule has no "every month" feature. And you can't do every 30 days for obvious reasons
#       One thing to do is make it every day, check if we're the first of the month, and then make the sheet if it is.
#       Else, make it a labor (we can create basically years worth of months now, make it not an issue)
# [ ] Swap to new sheet at start of month
#       With this in mind, seems like we'll just have
# [X] Periodically (weekly?) Ping the mods with the link to the google sheet.
# [X] The sheet should have a row to let other mods know it's already been given points.
