# House Points Bot (for use in [r/harrypotter](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter))

## What is this bot?

Hello! I'm a bot who helps collect house points-worthy posts for the heads of 
[r/hp](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter) to review! When people see a post or comment they 
really like (whether it be amazing fanart, detailed discussion, or any other awesome interaction),
they can suggest the post or comment for house points. I'll gather up all suggested submissions into
one nice and tidy list for the head of houses, head humans, and prefects to review. If they agree,
they'll dish out some points in an effort to [make it rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRv0agDZMjA)
with points all throughout the Great Hall! 

## How does this work?
To call me, just type ```+u/housepointsbot``` anywhere in your comment. That's all there is to it!
Note that you cannot suggest one of your own posts. I'll let you know when I've found your suggestion,
and will pass it on so our heads of hogwarts can review.
